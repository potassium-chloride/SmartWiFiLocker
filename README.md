# SmartWiFiLocker
Smart WiFi Lock for Android that scans wi-fi networks to check device position. Google SmartLock checks safe place by GPS (precision — more 10 m). This app uses wi-fi scanning (precision — about 1 m).

Minus: app don't use Trust API.

Interesting: all code has been writen in my smartphone, compiling by AIDE.

# Simple Install

For build use Android Studio

# Bugs
